# HUMAN-ACTION-RECOGNITION-IN-DARK

This project intends to implement a human activity recognition system, unlike commonly sampled data, in this project all videos are sampled in dark environments, which adds to the challenge of recognition compared to sampling environments with sufficient light. The whole project is divided into five parts, the first part is to sample video frames from the training video data; second part is to perform feature extraction on the data; the third part is to select a classifier, train the classifier with the training data and validate it with the validation set. The fourth part performs picture quality enhancement on the video data and observes the effect of enhancement on the classification accuracy. Finally creates a HAR model and implements end-to-end training.
